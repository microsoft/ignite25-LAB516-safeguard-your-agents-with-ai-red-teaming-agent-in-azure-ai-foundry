    "In this advanced lab, you'll conduct comprehensive security testing using **attack strategy groups** that combine multiple obfuscation techniques across three complexity levels.\n",

    "### Key Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Attack Complexity Levels**: Understand EASY, MODERATE, and DIFFICULT attack categories\n",
    "- ✅ **Attack Strategy Groups**: Use grouped strategies for comprehensive testing\n",
    "- ✅ **All Risk Categories**: Scan across all four supported risk types simultaneously\n",
    "- ✅ **Scale Testing**: Configure multi-objective scans with parallel execution\n",

    "## 🔬 What Are Attack Strategy Groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Attack strategies are techniques used to bypass AI safety measures by obfuscating harmful prompts. They're organized into three complexity levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Complexity Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "| Complexity | Effort Required | Resources Needed | Example Strategies |\n",
    "|------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **EASY** | Minimal | Simple encoding/transformation | Base64, Flip, Morse, Leetspeak |\n",
    "| **MODERATE** | Medium | Access to another AI model | Tense (past tense conversion) |\n",
    "| **DIFFICULT** | High | Multiple AI models + algorithms | Composition (Tense + Base64) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 Default Attack Strategy Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Microsoft Docs, here's what each group includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EASY Group\n",
    "Includes: `Base64`, `Flip`, `Morse`\n",
    "- **Base64**: Encodes prompts in base64 format\n",
    "- **Flip**: Reverses character order  \n",
    "- **Morse**: Converts text to Morse code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MODERATE Group\n",
    "Includes: `Tense`\n",
    "- **Tense**: Converts prompts to past tense (requires LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DIFFICULT Group\n",
    "Includes: Composition of `Tense` + `Base64`\n",
    "- **Composed Attack**: First converts to past tense, then encodes in Base64\n",
    "- **Why it's harder**: Combines multiple obfuscation layers\n",

    "|------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **EASY** | Base64, Flip, Morse | Script kiddie, automated tools | Low - Medium |\n",

    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-world attacks** often use multiple obfuscation techniques\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on your findings, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Filtering:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Apply Azure AI Content Safety filters\n",
    "from azure.ai.contentsafety import ContentSafetyClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure filter thresholds based on your ASR results\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "# Add safety instructions to your system prompt\n",
    "system_message = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Follow these safety guidelines:\n",
    "- Do not provide information that could cause harm\n",

    "\n",
    "After implementing mitigations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Re-run this scan** with the same configuration\n",
    "2. **Compare ASR** before and after mitigations\n",
    "3. **Verify improvements** across all risk categories\n",
    "4. **Document changes** for compliance and audit\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. 🧪 Custom Attack Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Try individual strategies for targeted testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Test specific obfuscation techniques\n",
    "attack_strategies=[\n",
    "    AttackStrategy.JAILBREAK,  # Prompt injection\n",
