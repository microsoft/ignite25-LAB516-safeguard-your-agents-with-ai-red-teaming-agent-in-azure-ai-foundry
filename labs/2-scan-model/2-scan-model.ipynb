    "# Lab 2: Scan AI Models and Applications with Red Teaming Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This lab will teach you how to run **AI Red Teaming Agent scans** on different types of targets - from simple callbacks to AI models and complete applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will:\n",
    "- Understand different scan target types (callbacks, models, applications)\n",
    "- Test simple fixed-response callbacks\n",
    "- Scan Azure OpenAI model deployments directly\n",
    "- Evaluate complete AI applications with custom logic\n",
    "- Use custom attack prompts for domain-specific testing\n",
    "- Compare attack strategies and complexity levels\n",
    "- Interpret Attack Success Rate (ASR) across scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains **four progressive exercises**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lab 2A**: Basic scan with fixed response callback (understanding the API)\n",
    "2. **Lab 2B**: Intermediate scan with model configuration (testing base models)\n",
    "3. **Lab 2C**: Advanced scan with application callback (real-world applications)\n",
    "4. **Lab 2D**: Custom prompts scan (domain-specific testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Target Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI Red Teaming Agent supports multiple target types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Simple Callback\n",
    "A function that takes a string prompt and returns a string response:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simple_callback(query: str) -> str:\n",
    "    return \"I'm an AI assistant that follows ethical guidelines.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model Configuration\n",
    "Direct configuration of an Azure OpenAI model deployment:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model_config = {\n",
    "    \"azure_endpoint\": \"https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com\",\n",
    "    \"azure_deployment\": \"gpt-4\",\n",
    "    \"api_key\": \"your-api-key\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Complex Callback (Chat Protocol)\n",
    "A function aligned to the OpenAI Chat Protocol for full application testing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def app_callback(messages: list, ...) -> dict:\n",
    "    # Your application logic with system prompts, RAG, etc.\n",
    "    return {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response}]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learn More**: [Supported Scan Targets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/run-scans-ai-red-teaming-agent#supported-targets)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attack Success Rate (ASR)\n",
    "The primary metric measuring the percentage of attacks that successfully elicit unsafe content. Lower is better!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Categories\n",
    "- **Violence**: Content intended to hurt, injure, or kill\n",
    "- **Sexual**: Sexual or adult content\n",
    "- **Hate/Unfairness**: Hateful or unfair representations\n",
    "- **Self-Harm**: Content promoting self-injury\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attack Complexity\n",
    "- **Baseline**: Direct unmodified prompts\n",
    "- **Easy**: Simple encodings (Base64, Flip, Morse)\n",
    "- **Moderate**: Requires AI resources (Tense conversion)\n",
    "- **Difficult**: Layered strategies (composition of multiple attacks)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed Lab 2 and learned how to scan different types of AI targets. 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Lab 2A**: Ran a basic scan with a fixed response callback to understand the API workflow  \n",
    "✅ **Lab 2B**: Scanned an Azure OpenAI model configuration to test foundational model safety  \n",
    "✅ **Lab 2C**: Evaluated a complete AI application with system prompts and few-shot examples  \n",
    "✅ **Lab 2D**: Used custom attack prompts for domain-specific safety testing  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Target Type Matters**: Different scan targets reveal different vulnerabilities\n",
    "   - Fixed callbacks → API validation\n",
    "   - Model configs → Base model safety\n",
    "   - App callbacks → End-to-end system safety\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attack Complexity**: More sophisticated attacks often have higher success rates\n",
    "   - Easy: Simple encodings (Base64, ROT13)\n",
    "   - Moderate: AI transformations (Tense)\n",
    "   - Difficult: Composed strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: Your primary metric\n",
    "   - 0% = Perfect safety (rare!)\n",
    "   - <10% = Strong safety posture\n",
    "   - >50% = Significant vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Prompts**: Essential for production readiness\n",
    "   - Test domain-specific risks\n",
    "   - Validate regulatory compliance\n",
    "   - Cover known edge cases\n",
